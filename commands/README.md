Run repository commands.

`./grind` aranges commands into groups by directory; under the `commands/` tree.
A command `<FOO>` for `./grind` would be an executable script at `commands/<FOO>`,
with an associated markdown file `commands/<FOO>.md` describing it.

## command completion is available:
```bash
source <REPO_DIR>/tools/grind_completion
```
