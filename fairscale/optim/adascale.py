class AdaScale(Optimizer):
    """
    Implements the AdaScale_ algorithm for scaling the learning rate for
    distributed and large batch size training. Can be used in combination with
    ``torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`` and ``torch.optim.SGD``.

    .. _AdaScale: https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/4682-Supplemental.pdf

    This class subclasses `Optimizer` so that `torch.optim.lr_scheduler` can
    work with it. In other words, AdaScale is intended to be a complete wrapper of an
    torch Optimizer.

    Note that, AdaScale does _not_ help increase per-GPU batch size.

    There are several ways to integrate AdaScale with your training loop.
    We show two examples below.

    Example 1: using PyTorch's `lr_scheduler` classes.

    .. code-block:: python

        optim = AdaScale(SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001))
        model = DistributedDataParallel(model)
        scheduler = LambdaLR(optim, lr_lambda=...)

        last_epoch = 0
        done = False
        step = 0
        while True:
            for batch in dataset:
                optim.zero_grad()
                logits = model()
                loss = criterion(logits, ...)
                loss.backward()
                step += optim.gain()
                optim.step()
                epoch = step // len(dataset)
                if epoch > last_epoch:
                    scheduler.step()
                    last_epoch = epoch
                if epoch >= max_epochs:
                    done = True

    Example 2: using a custom `update_lr()` function that update the learning
    rate based on the current step count per epoch.

    .. code-block:: python

        optim = AdaScale(SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001))
        model = DistributedDataParallel(model)

        step = 0
        while step < max_steps:
            for batch in ...:
                optim.zero_grad()
                logits = model()
                loss = criterion()
                loss.backward()
                step += optim.gain()
                optim.step()
                update_lr(step)

    Args:
        optimizer (torch.optim.Optimizer):
            Optimizer to apply AdaScale to.
        world_size (int):
            Number of world_size for distributed training.
            If None, defaults to ``dist.get_world_size()``.
        scale (float):
            Scaling factor of the batch size from scale equals 1, e.g. using a 10x
            larger batch size (summed across all ranks with gradient accumulation)
            means a scale of 10.
            If None, defaults to ``world_size * num_gradients_to_accumulate``.
        smoothing (float):
            Smoothing factor for moving average.
            If None, it defaults to ``max(1 - (world_size * num_gradients_to_accumulate)/1000, 0)``.
        num_gradients_to_accumulate (int):
            Number of passes that we accumulate gradients locally
            between each optimizer step. This can be changed during
            training as long as the train loop changes gradient accumulation
            accordingly.
            Default to 1, which does not accumulate gradients.
        debias_ewma (bool):
            (experimental) Use debias exponential moving average
            for smoothing and mu and sigma variables. False will
            use the method in the paper's Appendix B.3.
            Default: True, which is what have been validated so far.
