class FullyShardedDataParallel(nn.Module):
    """
    A wrapper for sharding Module parameters across data parallel workers. This
    is inspired by `Xu et al.`_ as well as the ZeRO Stage 3 from DeepSpeed_.
    FullyShardedDataParallel is commonly shorten to FSDP.

    .. _`Xu et al.`: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13336
    .. _DeepSpeed: https://www.deepspeed.ai/

    Pseudo-code usage::

        import torch
        from fairscale.nn.data_parallel import FullyShardedDataParallel as FSDP

        torch.cuda.set_device(device_id)
        sharded_module = FSDP(my_module)
        optim = torch.optim.Adam(sharded_module.parameters(), lr=0.0001)
        x = sharded_module(x, y=3, z=torch.Tensor([1]))
        loss = x.sum()
        loss.backward()
        optim.step()

    It is also possible to shard individual layers separately and have an outer
    wrapper handle any leftover parameters. This can be helpful to further
    reduce GPU memory usage, reduce system memory usage when initializing large
    models and to improve training speed by overlapping the all-gather step
    across the forward pass. For example::

        import torch
        from fairscale.nn.wrap import wrap, enable_wrap, auto_wrap
        from fairscale.nn.data_parallel import FullyShardedDataParallel as FSDP
        from fairscale.utils.testing import dist_init, teardown, rmf

        result = dist_init(0, 1, "/tmp/t1", "/tmp/t2")
        assert result
        fsdp_params = dict(wrapper_cls=FSDP, mixed_precision=True, flatten_parameters=True)
        with enable_wrap(**fsdp_params):
            l1 = wrap(torch.nn.Linear(5, 5))
            assert isinstance(l1, FSDP)
            # Wraps layer in FSDP by default if within context
            # Separately Wraps children modules with more than 1e8 params
            large_tfmr = torch.nn.Transformer(d_model=2048, num_encoder_layers=12,
                                              num_decoder_layers=12)
            l2 = auto_wrap(large_tfmr)
            assert isinstance(l2.encoder, FSDP)
            assert isinstance(l2.decoder, FSDP)
            print(l2)  # You can print the model to examine FSDP wrapping.
        teardown()
        rmf("/tmp/t1")
        rmf("/tmp/t2")

    .. warning::

        The optimizer must be initialized *after* the module has been wrapped,
        since FSDP will shard parameters in-place and this will break any
        previously initialized optimizers.

    .. warning::

        If you wrap every parameter inside a nested FSDP and leaving the outer
        FSDP empty without any parameter, checkpointing activation may trigger
        an assert on the backward pass. The solution is to leave some parameters
        to the outer FSDP.

    .. warning::

        If activation checkpointing is used with FSDP, it is strongly encouraged
        to use ``checkpoint_wrapper`` function from FairScale instead of the
        ``checkpoint`` function from PyTorch.

    Args:
        module (nn.Module):
            module to be wrapped with FSDP.
        process_group (Optional):
            process group for sharding
        process_group_reduce_scatter (Optional):
            process group for reduce scatter
            it defaults to ProcessGroupName.reduce_scatter. A seperate process group is initialized and assigned to the reduce_scatter operation. And the
            reduce_scatter operation overlaps with other operations in the backward propagation
            If it is a specific ProcessGroup, the reduce_scatter operates on this ProcessGroup, and the overlap still happens.
            To disable the overlap feature, set the process group to ProcessGroupName.default. In this case, the reduce_scatter
            operation uses the same process group with the default group.
            If reduce scatter process group size is differnt with the default process group size, the reduce_scatter
            operation rolls back to use the same process group with the default process group.
        reshard_after_forward (bool, Optional):
            if ``True``, reshard parameters after the forward pass. This saves
            memory but slows training. This is only relevant when resharding
            individual layers.
        disable_reshard_on_root (bool, Optional):
            If ``True``, ``reshard_after_forward`` will be set to ``False`` if the module is a
            FSDP root module to improve performance. For some cases, we do not reshard the full
            parameters of an FSDP root module since those parameters are needed immediately for the
            backward pass.
            If ``False``, the performance will be lower, but it is needed because it helps to
            save memory. Consider a case that an FSDP root module is a submodule of a model.
            Backward pass may not start immediate after the FSDP root module finishes its forward.
            So, reshard the parameters for the FSDP root modules can help to save memory in this case.
            In certain cases, the performance is not even slower, because the cached full param
            state may be stale due to load_local_state_dict() calls anyway.
            Default: True.
        mixed_precision (bool, Optional):
            if ``True``, inputs, activations and gradients will be kept in FP16;
            computation and communication will occur in FP16; and a (sharded)
            master copy of the model weights will be maintained in FP32.
        fp32_reduce_scatter (bool, Optional):
            if ``True``, then reduce-scatter gradients in FP32. This is only
            relevant when *``mixed_precision``* is ``True``.
        flatten_parameters (bool, Optional):
            if ``True``, flatten parameters into a single contiguous tensor,
            which improves training speed.
        move_params_to_cpu (bool, Optional):
            if ``True``, offload params to CPU.
            Default: False
        compute_dtype (torch.dtype, Optional):
            dtype for full parameters for computation. This defaults to
            ``torch.float32`` unless *``mixed_precision``* is set, in which case
            it defaults to ``torch.float16``.
        buffer_dtype (torch.dtype, Optional):
            dtype for buffers for computation. This defaults to ``compute_dtype``.
        move_grads_to_cpu (bool, Optional):
            move gradient shard to CPU after reduction. This is useful when
            combined with CPU-based optimizers. It defaults to the value of
            *``move_params_to_cpu``*.
        bucket_cap_mb (int, Optional):
            FSDP will bucket parameters so that gradient reduction can
            be more efficient for small parameters.
            ``bucket_cap_mb`` controls the bucket size in MegaBytes (MB). Buckets
            are sub-divided based on world_size, so the max shard size is roughly
            ``bucket_cap_mb / world_size``. There is one bucketer (with potentially
            multiple ``bucket_cap_mb`` sized buffers shared by all FSDP instances.
            Large gradient tensors are directly reduced without using the buffers.
            The buffers are there to reduce communication overhead for small tensors.
            Overlapping with computation happens due to use of a different CUDA stream
            than the computation CUDA stream. The total memory overhead per buffer is around
            ``bucket_cap_mb / world_size * (world_size + 1)``.
            The buffers are allocated during the backward pass and freed at the end
            of the backward pass to save more memory for other phases of the
            training process.
            Note, the memory vs. speed tradeoff of bucket size is very different
            from that of the DDP engine. In DDP, the buffer size ``1MB + n*cap_mb``,
            until n is big enough to cover the entire model size. The order
            of which buffer is ready there is more rigid and DDP requires all
            gradients to be computed in the backward. In FSDP, the buffer size
            does not change with model size (it changes based on number of
            <dtype, device, process_group> tuples) and gradient ready order matters
            little since FSDP has a final flush call that ensures everything is reduced
            and not all gradients need to be upfront known. Overlapping with compute is
            done differently too.
            Values <= 0 disable bucketing.
            Default: 25.
        compute_device (torch.device, Optional):
            device for computation. If not given and module params are on a CUDA
            device, the param's device will be used. If not given and module
            params are on CPU, then the current CUDA device (as indicated by
            ``torch.cuda.current_device()`` will be used.
        no_broadcast_optim_state: (bool, Optional)
            do not broadcast this modules optimizer state when ``gather_full_optim_state_dict`` is called.
            If you set this true, you are expected to overwrite the relevant state entries of the returned optimizer state dict
            with the proper state at each rank. This is useful for situations, like Mixture Of Experts,
            where all but a few parameters can fit on one node.
            Default: False
        state_dict_device (torch.device, Optional):
            device for parameters returned by :func:`state_dict`. If not given,
            this will default to ``compute_device``. Note that only the device
            type will be respected (e.g., "cuda:0" and "cuda:1" are the same).
        clear_autocast_cache (bool):
            When using mixed precision training with `torch.amp.autocast`, if the model weights
            are in FP32, autocast maintains a cache for downcasted weights. The cache can cause
            GPU OOM during the forward pass. Setting this flag to true will help clearing this
            cache as inner FSDP instances finish part of the forward pass to save GPU memory.
            Default: False
        force_input_to_fp32 (bool):
            Set to ``True`` to force input floating point tensors to be FP32 (if they are FP16)
            when the FSDP instance is in full precision mode. This helps avoid issues of running
            SyncBatchNorm with AMP and checkpoint_wrapper.
            Default: False
        verbose (bool):
            Set this to ``True`` to turn on verbose output for model's string representation.
            Default: False
        cpu_offload (bool, Optional):
            if ``True``, offload params to CPU. Note: This arg will be deprecated in favor of
            *``move_params_to_cpu``* in an upcoming release.
        state_dict_on_rank_0_only (bool):
            When set to ``True``, ``model.state_dict()`` will only returns full state dict on
            rank 0 and return empty dict non-rank 0, which allow FullyShardedDataParallel to
            skip the GPU -> CPU copy on non-rank 0 altogether and prevent OOM.
            Default: False
        gradient_predivide_factor (float, optional):
            If supplied, pre-divide the gradients before scatter-reduce.
            Default: None
        allow_reset_parameters (bool):
            If True, allow ``reset_parameters`` API to be proxied to the wrapped module.
            Default: False

        Register backward hooks to reshard params and reduce-scatter grads.

        This is called during forward pass. The goal is to attach a hook
        on each of the parameter's gradient generating function (``grad_acc``
        below) so that the hook is called *after* all gradients for that
        param are computed.

        Goals:

        1. We want the hook to fire once and only once *after* all gradients
        are accumulated for a param.
        2. If it fires more than once, we end up incorrectly shard the grad
        multiple times. (could lead to dimension too small)
        3. If it fires once but too early or doesn't fire, we leave gradients
        unsharded. (could lead to dimension too large)

        There are several cases here:
        1. We can call the same module multiple times in a single outer forward
           pass. We register multiple hooks but autograd should fire the last
           one after the total gradient is computed and accumulated. If it does
           fire multiple times, we may have a crash due to gradient being already
           sharded and shape mismatch.
           On the other hand, due to _saved_grad_shard, this case may also work
           but with extra grad scatter-gather.
        2. With activation checkpointing and case 1.
        3. The same outer forward can be called multiple times before any backward
           is called (within the no_sync context) for a special way of gradient
           accumulation. (see test_fsdp_fwd_fwd_bwd_bwd.py)
        4. When a param is shared by multiple FSDP wrapper instances, this can
           register multiple times. (See test_fsdp_shared_weights.py)

        It appears that registering the hook everytime and let them fire and
        hook being removed/freed automatically is the correct thing to do. But this
        is purely based on experiments.

    Auto wrap all BatchNorm (BN) instances with a safer FSDP, esp. when convert
    to sync BN is used and the outer FSDP is flattening.

    We put BN in is own full precision, unflatten, single GPU group FSDP.  Note, SyncBNs still have
    a group size == world_size. The input and output for BN are still FP16 in mixed precision mode.
    See ``keep_batchnorm_fp32`` here: https://nvidia.github.io/apex/amp.html

            This might be needed for Apex sync BN support. Still under construction.
        process_group (ProcessGroup):
            Optional process group to be used.
