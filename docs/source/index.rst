*fairscale* is a PyTorch extension library for high performance and
large scale training for optimizing training on one or across multiple
machines/nodes. This library extend basic pytorch capabilities while
adding new experimental ones.


Components
----------

* Parallelism:
   * `pipeline parallelism <../../build/html/api/nn/pipe.html>`_
   * `tensor parallelism <../../build/html/api/nn/model_parallel.html>`_
* Optimization:
   * `optimizer state sharding <../../build/html/api/optim/oss.html>`_
   * `sharded grad scaler - AMP <../../build/html/api/optim/grad_scaler.html>`_
   * `AdaScale SGD <../../build/html/api/optim/adascale.html>`_


.. warning::
    This library is under active development.
    Please be mindful and create an
    `issue <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale/issues>`_
    if you have any trouble and/or suggestion.
