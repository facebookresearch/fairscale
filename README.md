## Description
FairScale is a PyTorch extension library for high performance and large scale training.
This library extends basic PyTorch capabilities while adding new SOTA scaling techniques.
FairScale makes available the latest distributed training techniques in the form of composable
modules and easy to use APIs. These APIs are a fundamental part of a researcher's toolbox as
they attempt to scale models with limited resources.

FairScale was designed with the following values in mind:

* **Usability** -  Users should be able to understand and use FairScale APIs with minimum cognitive overload.

* **Modularity** - Users should be able to combine multiple FairScale APIs as part of their training loop seamlessly.

* **Performance** - FairScale APIs provide the best performance in terms of scaling and efficiency.

## Installation

To install FairScale, please see the following [instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale/blob/main/docs/source/installation_instructions.rst).
You should be able to install a package with pip or conda, or build directly from source.

## Getting Started
The full [documentation](https://fairscale.readthedocs.io/) contains instructions for getting started, deep dives and tutorials about the various FairScale APIs.

## FSDP

FullyShardedDataParallel (FSDP) is the recommended method for scaling to large NN models.
This library has been [upstreamed to PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-pytorch-fully-sharded-data-parallel-api/).
The version of FSDP here is for historical references as well as for experimenting with
new and crazy ideas in research of scaling techniques. Please see the following blog
for [how to use FairScale FSDP and how does it work](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/15/open-source/fsdp/).

## Testing

We use circleci to test FairScale with the following PyTorch versions (with CUDA 11.2):
* the latest stable release (e.g. 1.10.0)
* the latest LTS release (e.g. 1.8.1)
* a recent nightly release (e.g. 1.11.0.dev20211101+cu111)

Please create an [issue](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale/issues) if you are having trouble with installation.
