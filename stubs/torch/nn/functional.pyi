# These stubs were generated by running stubgen (`stubgen --parse-only functional.py`), followed by manual cleaning.
#
# The 'BroadcastingList{1,2,3}' types were replaced by `_size` or _output_ratio, as appropriate.
# This was necessary since the JIT uses BroadcastingList* types but static checking with mypy etc requires a `Sequence`
# type. There is no way to express the expected lengths of these lists in the current Python typing system.
#
# Functions created via `_add_docstr` in `functional.py` where merely typed as `Any` by `stubgen`, so those were 
# deleted from the stub and replaced by generated declarations. See `gen_pyi` for the implementation of the code 
# generation logic for those functions. In the future, it might be worth looking into using the mypy plugin system 
# to encode the type semantics of `_add_docstr`, should that system ever become widespread.
